    SparsityCorrelativeTerm(relaxation::AbstractRelaxation; method=TERM_MODE_BLOCK, kwargs...)

Analyze both the [correlative as well as the term sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02828v2) of the problem.
This is the most versatile kind of sparsity analysis, combining the effects of correlative sparsity with term analysis per
clique. However, it is nothing more than first performing correlative sparsity analysis, followed by term sparsity analysis.
This constructor will take all keyword arguments and distribute them appropriately to the [`SparsityCorrelative`](@ref)
and [`SparsityTerm`](@ref) constructors.
The returned object will be a very thin wrapper around [`SparsityTerm`](@ref), with the only difference in printing;
[`SparsityCorrelativeTerm`](@ref) objects by default print the clique grouping.
