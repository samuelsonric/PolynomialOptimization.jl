    RelaxationGroupings

Contains information about how the elements in a certain (sparse) polynomial optimization problem combine.
Groupings are contained in the fields `obj`, `zero`, `nonneg`, and `psd`:
- `∑ᵢ transpose(objᵢ) * σᵢ * conj(objᵢ)` is the SOS representation of the objective with `σᵢ` PSD
- `∑ᵢ transpose(zeroₖᵢ) * fₖ * conj(zeroₖᵢ)` is the prefactor for the kᵗʰ equality constraint with `fₖ` a free matrix
- `∑ᵢ transpose(nonnegₖᵢ) * σₖᵢ * conj(nonnegₖᵢ)` is the SOS representation of the prefactor of the kᵗʰ nonnegative constraint
  with `σₖᵢ` PSD
- `∑ᵢ (transpose(psdₖᵢ) ⊗ 𝟙) * Zₖᵢ * (conj(psdₖᵢ) ⊗ 𝟙)` is the SOS matrix representation of the prefactor of the kᵗʰ PSD
  constraint with Zₖᵢ PSD
The field `var_cliques` contains a list of sets of variables, each corresponding to a variable clique in the total problem. In
the complex case, only the declared variables are returned, not their conjugates.

    iterate!(state::AbstractPORelaxation; objective=true, zero=true, nonneg=true, psd=true)

Some sparse polynomial optimization relaxations allow to iterate their sparsity, which will lead to a more dense representation
and might give better bounds at the expense of a more costly optimization. Return `nothing` if the iterations converged
(`state` did not change any more), else return the new state. Note that `state` will be modified.

The keyword arguments allow to restrict the iteration to certain elements. This does not necessarily mean that the bases
associated to other elements will not change as well to keep consistency; but their own contribution will not be considered.
The parameters `nonneg` and `psd` may either be `true` (to iterate all those constraints) or a set of integers that refer to
the indices of the constraints, as they were originally given to [`poly_problem`](@ref).
