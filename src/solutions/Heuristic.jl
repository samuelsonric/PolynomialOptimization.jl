    poly_solutions(:heuristic, result::Result; verbose=false)

Apply a heuristic solution extraction mechanism to a solved polynomial optimization problem. If there is only a single
solution, the heuristic will always work (but is much faster than a rank factorization). It may in certain cases also work if
there are multiple solutions if the individual components only differ by their signs/phases. This method can also be applied in
the presence of term sparsity, where [`poly_solutions`](@ref) fails.
This function gives a vector of solutions (not an iterator, as [`poly_solutions`](@ref) does).

See also [`poly_optimize`](@ref).
