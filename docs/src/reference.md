## SpecBM
While the solver was implemented for the purpose of being used within `PolynomialOptimization`, it also works as a standalone
routine (and could in principle be a separate package). SpecBM is a
[spectral bundle algorithm for primal semidefinite programs](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.07651) and is based on the
assumption that the optimal dual solution has low rank; indeed, in polynomial optimizations, if there is an optimal point for
the problem that can be encoded in the chosen basis, then this automatically gives rise to a rank-one semidefinite encoding of
this point.
The implementation also allows for free variables and multiple semidefinite constraints and contains further improvements
compared to the [reference implementation](https://github.com/soc-ucsd/specBM). It requires either Hypatia or a very recent
version of Mosek as subsolvers.

## FastVector
To improve the speed in some implementation details, `PolynomialOptimization` provides a "fast" vector type. This is basically
just a wrapper around the stdlib `Vector`; however, it actually takes proper advantage of sizehints. The fact that Julia does
this badly has been known for quite some time ([#24909](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/24909)), but the default
implementation has not changed. Our own `FastVec` is a bit more specific than the
[PushVector](https://github.com/tpapp/PushVectors.jl), but also allows for more aggressive optimization.
```@docs
FastVec
Base.sizehint!(::FastVec, ::Integer)
prepare_push!
Base.push!(::FastVec{V}, el) where {V}
unsafe_push!
Base.append!(::FastVec{V}, ::AbstractVector) where {V}
unsafe_append!
Base.prepend!(::FastVec{V}, ::AbstractVector) where {V}
unsafe_prepend!
Base.similar(::FastVec{V}) where {V}
finish!
```

## PackedMatrices
The SpecBM solver works with matrices in packed storage format. There are a lot of LAPACK routines that natively support this
format, which offers superior storage (at the cost of worse runtime and precision); however, Julia does not natively provide
a convenient way to work with packed matrices or even just wrapper functions. The submodule `PackedMatrices` provides this
functionality (though not every LAPACK function was exported; the development was guided by what was needed for
`PolynomialOptimization`).

CurrentModule = PolynomialOptimization.PackedMatrices

### LAPACK wrappers
Note that unless noted, these functions are only wrappers for real-valued LAPACK functions. No other data types than native single and double precision are therefore supported.
